But it hides the data; we have no indication of how much data there is, how variable the data are in each year, nor what the shape of the distributions are. Therefore, it can be useful to display both the data in one plot (e.g., a histogram) and the population mean estimates in another plot (bar plot). Or, once you've mastered the basics, you can create more complex graphs that combine data and estimates in a single plot."
