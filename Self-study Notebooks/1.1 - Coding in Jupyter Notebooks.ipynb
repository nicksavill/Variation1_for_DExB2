    "Over the next few weeks you will learn the basics of coding and statistics. To do this we are using a **programming language** called **Python**. Python is an easy-to-learn, but very powerful, programming language. As well as powering many of the apps on your phone, Python is widely used in industry and science including the Biological and Medical Sciences.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be able to write Python code and then run it you need to use a programming environment. There are many such environments; the one you will be using in this course is called a **Jupyter Notebook**. In fact, what you are reading now is a Jupyter Notebook. They are widely used in science because both text, images, videos and code can be combined into a single document within a web browser. So they can be accessed anywhere that has an internet connection.\n",

    "At Edinburgh Uni Jupyter Notebooks are stored and run on a service called **Noteable**. This service is always available so you can use it any time you need to write some code. You will be using Noteable not only in this course but in the Discovery course in semester 2 and other courses in later years.\n",
