The bigger and more useful part of statistics, called **inferential statistics**, is the part that lets scientists make **inferences** about the wider world and lets them test their ideas about how the natural world works. The word \"inference\" means the forming of a conclusion from data.\n",

    "\n",
    "As researchers, you, and the scientific community, are not particularly interested in a sample of data. What we are actually interested in is the population of individuals from which the sample was drawn. It is this population we want to say something about, not the single small sample drawn from it. \n",
    "\n",
    "What is a population?\n",
    "\n",
    "That really depends on the scientific question you want to answer. So there is no one-size-fits-all answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the field trips you collected data on the size of two-spot ladybirds in Edinburgh graveyards. If you want to understand how the density of Harlequin ladybirds affects the sizes of two-spot ladybirds, and that density varies between Edinburgh graveyards, then each graveyard is a separate population. However, if you want to understand how climate affects the size of two-spot ladybirds then your populations may be separate regions of a country or even different countries because climate varies on larger geographical scales than graveyards.\n",
    "\n",
    "Irrespective of how we define the population, the critical point is that a sample is a subset of a population, and usually a tiny subset of a population. Observational and experimental studies should be designed so that individuals are **randomly** sampled from a population. Which means that the chance an individual is sampled is the same for all individuals in the population. This is often easier said than done, but we don't have time in this course to discuss this thorny issue properly."
